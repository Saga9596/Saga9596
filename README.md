# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sagar Siripuram

🌿 **Sustainability Analyst | Environmentalist | Impact-Driven Innovator**

I’m on a mission to redefine how we think about materials, design, and climate action — one LCA at a time. With 5+ years spanning sustainability analytics, civil engineering, and systems innovation, I merge data-driven insights with a passion for meaningful change. Currently working remotely from Gujarat for **WAP Sustainability**, where I deep-dive into EPDs, GHG inventories, and embodied carbon assessments.
